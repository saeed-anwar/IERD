## Introduction
We propose to learn a fully-convolutional network model that consists of a Chain of Identity Mapping Modules and residual on the residual architecture for image denoising.
Our network structure possesses three distinctive features that are important for the noise removal task. Firstly, each unit employs identity mappings as the skip connections and receives pre-activated input to preserve the gradient magnitude propagated in both the forward and backward directions. Secondly, by utilizing dilated kernels for the convolution layers in the residual branch, each neuron in the last convolution layer of each module can observe the full receptive field of the first layer. Lastly, we employ the residual on the residual architecture to ease the propagation of the high-level information. Contrary to current state-of-the-art real denoising networks, we also present a straightforward and single-stage network for real image denoising.

The proposed network produces remarkably higher numerical accuracy and better visual image quality than the classical state-of-the-art and CNN algorithms when being evaluated on the three conventional benchmark and three real-world datasets

Denoising results: In the first row, an image is corrupted by the Gaussian noise with Ïƒ = 50 from the BSD68 dataset. In the second row, a sample image from the RNI15 real noisy dataset. Our results have the best PSNR score for synthetic images, and unlike other methods, it does not have over-smoothing or over-contrasting artifacts. 

## Network
The proposed network architecture, which consists of multiple modules with similar structures. Each module is composed of a series of pre-activation-convolution layer pairs. The multiplier block negates the input block features to be summed at the end of the mapping module

## Requirements
The model is built in PyTorch 0.4.0, PyTorch 0.4.1 and tested on Ubuntu 14.04/16.04 environment (Python3.6, CUDA9.0, cuDNN5.1). 

## Test
### Quick start
1. Download the trained models for our paper and place them in '/TestCode/experiment'.

    The real denoising model can be downloaded from [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1QxO6KFOVxaYYiwxliwngxhw_xCtInSHd) or [here](https://icedrive.net/0/e3Cb4ifYSl). The total size for all models is 5MB.

2. Cd to '/TestCode/code', run the following scripts.

    **You can use the following script to test the algorithm**

    ```bash
    #RIDNET
    CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 python main.py --data_test MyImage --noise_g 1 --model RIDNET --n_feats 64 --pre_train ../experiment/ridnet.pt --test_only --save_results --save 'RIDNET_RNI15' --testpath ../LR/LRBI/ --testset RNI15
    ```


## Results
**All the results for IERD can be downloaded from GoogleDrive from [SSID](), [RNI15]() and [DnD](). The size of the results is 65MB**
